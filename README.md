# MewPro_Iliad
A Sync Generator/Controller for Hero 4 Black/Silver and MewPro.

### Supported video modes

We thought we've already supported all the video modes that Black and/or Silver could do. But that was false. (Hero 4 adjusts fps when the "low light" option is set. And we deceived by this function... How foolish we are!)

>Note: Currently we are very hard to work supporting more video modes. So please check this document again if your favorite video mode is not supported, yet.

The following video modes are known to work with Iliad + MewPro and Hero 4 Black.
